## Warning this code is extremely messy! I will be refactoring and cleaning up this project heavily over the next couple of weeks. If you are thinking of contributing, it might be best to wait until I clean up the mess I made in building this.

# Inovelli LED Strip Toolbox

https://nathanfiscus.github.io/inovelli-led-strip-toolbox/

This is a simple application to assist in calculating the configuration values to send to your Inovelli ZWave LED Strip controller. The values calculated by this tool can be used by any compatible ZWave controller.

# PWA!

This is a progressive web app and can be installed on your local device for offline use or install like a mobile app.

# Sharing

You can share your custom programs from the application to forums or other social platforms.  The link will automatically import the program to the application.

# Home Assistant Integration

Using a Long Lived Access Token, you can interface this tool with your Home Assistant instance to send custom programs to your Inovelli LED Strip controller.
